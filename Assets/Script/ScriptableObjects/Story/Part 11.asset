  story: "You are already able to see the summit. Probably another 20 to 30 minutes
    to go. You can\u2019t wait to finally head back home again. This adventure turned
    out to be awful. It looks like Ben has changed after all. All he does is talk
    about himself and how great he is. It was a stupid idea to agree to go on this
    trip.\r\nNow it also starts to rain, which doesn\u2019t help your mood. Raindrops
    hit your face and mix up with your sweat. Annoyed, you wipe them away.\r\nSuddenly
    Ben loses his grip and falls into the safety rope. His weight is pulling you
    down. Ben is struggling to get back on track. Due to his uncontrollable movements,
    your harness is cutting into the flesh of your thigh. You grimace with pain."
  hint: Fast, you should <i>help</i> your friend!
