  story: "The knife slips from your hand while you watch Ben\u2019s shocked face
    as he plunges into certain death. You hurry back to civilisation, but the bad
    weather makes the descent difficult. It takes you a long time before you reach
    an area with cell service. You immediately call for the emergency services. Together,
    you hurry and search for Ben, but any help for Ben comes too late."
