  story: "You can\u2019t do it. You aren\u2019t strong enough. Ben is going to drag
    you both down.\r\nCarefully you try to convert all of the weight into one hand.
    The additional ballast is hurting your shoulder. With your free hand, you try
    to reach your pants. Your hand slides into your pocket and you can feel the cold
    metal in your hand. You pause for a moment. When you pull out your hand, it\u2019s
    shaking. The knife feels heavy.\r\nShould you really do this? You may be able
    to hold on for a little longer. But no one\u2019s going to save you. There is
    no help, there will be no help. You are the only people on this mountain.\r\nIf
    you don\u2019t cut the safety rope, Ben will kill you both. If you cut the safety
    rope at least one of you could live.\r\nBen has been a total jerk to you all
    day. He has been bragging about his money and his house all the time. And you
    tried your best to help him. But even now, he isn\u2019t listening to you and
    won\u2019t stop moving. If he only listened to you, you could help him. But he
    won\u2019t!\r\nYou feel your hand slowly losing grip. You have to cut the safety
    rope, name."
  hint: You have to <i>cut</i> the rope!
