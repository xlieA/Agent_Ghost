  story: "You are in the wall for a couple of hours. You and Ben are having a great
    time. You talk a lot about how your lives have changed since high school.\r\nIt
    seems Ben has the life he always dreamed of: a nice house, a good job and a beautiful
    wife who\u2019s pregnant with their first son. You haven\u2019t quite accomplished
    anything notable. Nothing like your high school self planned out for you.\r\nYou
    continue to climb for a few more hours, but it\u2019s starting to get a bit cloudy."
  hint: This would be a great time for a little <i>break</i>.
